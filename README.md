# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data

### A. Introduction
In this project, we'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up.

### The data
This dataset comes from [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
